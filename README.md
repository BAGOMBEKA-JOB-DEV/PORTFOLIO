# 🚀 My Portfolio Web App

**Everyone needs their own little spot on the interwebs, and this is mine.**
✨ **Welcome to my resume, on the web!** ✨

---

## 📌 Introduction

This is the official **open-source** repository of my website/resume, aptly titled **Resume on the Web**. It is built on the **latest technologies**, putting together everything I have learned over the years into practice. 🛠️💡

The website showcases various elements from across the web, from server setups to page animations. This `README.md` serves as a **feature list** and a **proof of source** for anyone who wants to fork, modify, and create their own version (with due credits, of course). 🏗️🌍

## 💡 About the Project

🚀 **Resume on the Web** has been my passion project since early **2024**. I didn't want my information confined to just a sheet of paper that only **HRs** or **Talent Scouts** could see—I wanted it to be **accessible to everyone**. 🌍✨

I continuously **update** the site to reflect who I am because just like me, this website is not **static**! 💡🔄 This project allows me to **explore new frameworks**, **experiment with design**, and challenge myself while keeping it simple and informative. 

🔧 **Built with:**
- **[Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org/)** (React) ⚛️
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** 🎨
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** for hosting 🌐

💬 If you loved the site, drop me a message via the [contact form](#contact). I'd be **ecstatic** to hear from you! 📨

🔓 The complete source code is **open-source** and licensed under **[MIT License](https://github.com/BAGOMBEKA-JOB-DEV/PORTOFOLIO/blob/main/LICENSE)**. Feel free to fork and build your own version! 💻🛠️

          <strong><b><i>This Website</i></b></strong> has been a passion project of mine since early 2024. I didn&apos;t want my
          story to live on a boring piece of paper only seen by HRs or talent scouts. I wanted everyone to have access to it â€” and thatâ€™s how this project came to life.
        </p>

        <p>
          I keep it updated to reflect who I am, because like this site, Iâ€™m always evolving. I build it with the latest tech, constantly pushing myself to explore new frameworks, tools, and design ideas â€” all while keeping one core goal in mind: making it easy for you to get to know me.
        </p>

        <p>
          This version was crafted using NextJS (React), styled with Tailwind CSS for its utility-first magic, and deployed via VERCEL.

          I truly hope you enjoyed exploring this site as much as I loved creating and learning through it. If it resonated with you, drop me a message using the contact form â€” Iâ€™d be thrilled to hear from you.
